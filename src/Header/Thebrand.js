        <strong>The Founder Of London's West End</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Jermyn Street dates back to 1664 when Henry Jermyn, Earl of St Albans,
        was granted land from Charles II in an area known as St James's Field.
        Henry Jermyn developed St James's Square which was surrounded by grand
        houses with four streets leading from it. From the beginning, the
        development grew into a fashionable address. As a result of his
        development, Henry Jermyn is regarded as the 'founder' of London's West
        End

      <p>
        Jermyn Street has had many renowned residents over the years. Sir Isaac
        Newton lived on Jermyn Street from 1697 until he moved to Chelsea in
        1709. William Blake was baptised at Wren's Church of St James's which
        was considered to be one of the most fashionable churches in London. The
        author, Sir Walter Scott, and the poet Thomas Gray both resided on the
        street.
